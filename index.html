                Our Mission
            </h2>
            <p>
           Our mission is to inspire and teach kids and teenagers about the importance of recycling and living sustainably. We want to make recycling a part of everyday life by encouraging eco-friendly habits. By working with schools, we aim to build a network of kids who understand their impact on the environment. Our projects help reduce waste and keep it out of landfills through creative recycling solutions. We believe that by giving children the knowledge and tools to make sustainable choices, we can create a greener future for our planet.
